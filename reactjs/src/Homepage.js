          Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. 
          Our project aims to develop and evaluate a virtual reality (VR) therapeutic tool designed to improve attention and reduce hyperactivity in children aged 6-11 with ADHD.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary goal is to create an engaging and interactive VR experience that effectively addresses the core symptoms of ADHD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our objectives include:
          <ul>
            <li>Designing and developing a VR environment tailored to the cognitive and developmental needs of children with ADHD.</li>
            <li>Incorporating a variety of therapeutic activities, such as games, puzzles, and cognitive exercises, to target ADHD symptoms.</li>
            <li>Implementing a robust progress tracking system to monitor treatment efficacy.</li>
            <li>Disseminating research findings to contribute to the field of ADHD treatment.</li>
